WORD WRAP KATA
Source: http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataWordWrap

Original:

You write a class called Wrapper, that has a single static function named wrap that takes two arguments, a string, and a column number. 
The function returns the string, but with line breaks inserted at just the right places to make sure that no line is longer than the column number. 
You try to break lines at word boundaries.
Like a word processor, break the line by replacing the last space in a line with a newline. 

Modified:

STEP-INSTRUCTION-PER-TEST VERSION

Create a string manipulation class with method wrapLine(NSString* input) byColumnWidth(NSInteger width)

1) When the column width is 0, the return value should have no line breaks.

2) When the column width is 20, the return value should have line breaks at exactly the width specified.

3) When the input text is shorter than the column width, the return value should have no line breaks.

4) When the column width < 20, the column width is rejected as too short for a line wrap

5) Add a new boolean parameter BOOL withWordBreak which when true, breaks the line at word boundaries, AFTER the space.

6) When words are included that are > than column width and word break is true, reject the line as not compatible with word wrap

7) Repeat test #5 only in a new test class against an string extension / NSString category class.
