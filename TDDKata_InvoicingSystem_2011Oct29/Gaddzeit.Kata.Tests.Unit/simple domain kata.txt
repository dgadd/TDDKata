Simple Domain Kata (emphasis on equality and associations)
Tests will be delineated as M (for Mechanics, such as ORM equality) or B (for Business requirement).

LESSONS LEARNED:
1) Object equality by ID
2) Associations maintain uniqueness through set

THE KATA
Remember that all of the following has to be achieved test-first:

A. Start with a common base class to handle object equality on an ID
1. M: Two instances of DomainEntityBase are equal when they have the same ID value
2. M: Two instances are NOT equal when they have different ID values
3. M: Two instances are NOT equal when they have 0 ID values.

B. Invoice and its LineItems
1. M: Verify that Invoice is an instance of DomainEntityBase.
2. M: Verify that LineItem is an instance of DomainEntityBase.
3. M: Verify that Invoice has a read-only collection of LineItems.
4. M: Verify that adding a LineItem to Invoice increases its count of LineItems from 0 to 1
5. M: Verify that adding the SAME LineItem (by identifier) does not increment the set of LineItems.
6. B: Given an existing LineItem, when I try to add a LineItem without a ProductCode, 
then I am informed that I must provide a ProductCode.
7. B: Given an existing LineItem, when I try to add another LineItem with the same ProductCode, 
then the original LineItem for that ProductCode has its Quantity incremented by the quantity of the added item.
8. B: Given a set of LineItems, when I check the SubTotal for the Invoice, 
then the SubTotal matches Sum of the Quantity of LineItems times the Price.
